The white bird follows your mouse. Lead the flock and create new patterns!

# About
Neon Birds is a flocking simulation. Birds follow three simple rules when flocking:

1. Adhesion: Match velocity (speed and direction) with other birds
2. Cohesion: Stay close to other birds
3. Repulsion: Don't bump into other birds

The birds are colored by the direction they face. The angular nature of colors (think color wheel) suits this well. Plus, it helps you identify flocks easily, since birds in a flock tend to face the same direction according to rule 1.

The [full-page version]({{site.url}}/birds/) has sliders that let you control the strength of the three rules. One thing to try:

- Turn cohesion, turn speed and flock size all the way up to create a giant bird blob.
- Click "fear white bird" and tunnel through the blob - the blob will split and rejoin around you, which is an emergent behavior of the three rules.
- If you have "follow white bird" checked along with "fear", then you can even get the birds to create a circle of fear around you!

Try other combinations for tons of other interesting emergent patterns.
