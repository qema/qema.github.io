<h1>Cornell Conversational Analysis Toolkit (version 2.0)</h1>
<p>This toolkit contains tools to extract conversational features and analyze social phenomena in conversations.  Several large <a href="http://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/socialkit/datasets/">conversational datasets</a> are included together with scripts exemplifying the use of the toolkit on these datasets.</p>
<p>The toolkit currently implements features for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/Coordination_README.md">Linguistic coordination</a>, a measure of relative power between individuals or groups based on their use of function words (see the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html">Echoes of Power</a> paper)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/QuestionTypology_README.md">Question typology</a>, a method for extracting surface motifs that recur in questions, and for grouping them according to their latent rhetorical role (see the <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Asking_too_much.html">Asking too much</a> paper). Optional parameters are also provided to use this method for extracting motifs from general conversational prompts, not just questions (see the <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Conversations_gone_awry.html">Conversations gone awry</a> paper)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/Politeness_README.md">Politeness strategies</a>, a set of lexical and parse-based features correlating with politeness and impoliteness (see the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Politeness.html">A computational approach to politeness</a> paper)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coming soon: Basic message and turn features, currently available here <a href="https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/tree/constructive/cornellversation/constructive">Constructive conversations</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
